### Security Features

HIDR Agent includes several security features:

- **Access Controls**: Configuration changes require administrator privileges
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative security settings by default

### Known Security Considerations

- HIDR Agent requires administrator privileges for full functionality
- Quarantine directory should be excluded from antivirus scans
- Network monitoring may capture sensitive data in logs
- False positives may impact legitimate applications
